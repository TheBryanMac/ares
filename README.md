ArcMap Raster Edit Suite
====================

Sometimes we need to edit just a few pixels of a raster layer in ArcMap, not all. For example, removing several misclassified pixels from a classification result is a very common situation. In ArcMap, tools we usually use to edit raster layer includes Reclassify and Raster Calculator. However, both of them aim at editing the raster layer as a whole and it takes a lot of additional work if only a few pixels are of interest. Editing a raster layer in ArcMap should be as simple and quick as what we deal with a feature layer. This addin makes this possible.

## Introduction

ArcMap Raster Edit Suite (ARES), previously called ArcMap Raster Editor, is an addin for ArcMap 10.x, providing a set of tools in order to improve the convenience of minor raster editing. Its main features include:

+ **Modify pixels just by click-and-edit**
+ **Identify pixels to get its row and column index**
+ **Go to pixel with given row and column index**

This addin is only compatible with ArcMap 10.x. 

A detailed user guide could be found at: **[ArcMap Raster Editor](https://github.com/dz316424/arcmap-raster-editor/wiki)**
