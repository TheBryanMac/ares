ArcMap Raster Edit Suite
====================

Sometimes we need to edit just a few pixels of a raster layer in ArcMap, not all. For example, removing several misclassified pixels from a classification result is a very common situation. In ArcMap, tools we usually use to edit raster layer are Reclassify and Raster Calculator. However, both of them aim at editing the raster layer as a whole and it takes a lot of additional work if only a few pixels are of interest. Editing a raster layer in ArcMap should be as simple and quick as what we deal with a feature layer. This addin makes this possible.

## Introduction

ArcMap Raster Edit Suite (ARES), previously called ArcMap Raster Editor, is an addin for ArcMap 10.0/10.1/10,2, providing a set of tools in order to improve the convenience of minor raster editing. Its main features include:

* Modify pixels just by click-and-edit

* Identify pixels to get their row and column index, as well as the statistic

* Go to pixel with given row and column index

This addin is only compatible with ArcMap 10.x. 

A detailed user guide could be found at [ArcMap Raster Edit Suite Wiki](https://github.com/dz316424/arcmap-raster-editor/wiki)

In case of possible bugs, it is recommanded to use the .tiff formart as your primary raster file format while using this addin.
